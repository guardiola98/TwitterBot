# TwitterBot
This project has the objetive of creting a twitter bot that spams memes. In the future, this project will grow up, in order to add some more interesting features to the bot.

## Media
For now, this bot only has a function that tweets a random image, the idea is to save all the images on static/images, and then u can use the function bot_random_image() on bot.py.
